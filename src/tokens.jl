"""
The only exported functions from this module are [`escape_value`](@ref) and [`unescape_value`](@ref) which are useful
when embedding values into query strings. The rest of the module is documented to give insight into how a query string
is broken into [`Token`](@ref)s.

Ideally `Daf` should have used some established parser generator module for parsing queries, making all this
unnecessary. However, As of writing this code, Julia doesn't seem to have such a parser generator solution. Therefore,
this module provides a simple [`tokenize`](@ref) function with rudimentary pattern matching which is all we need to
parse queries (whose structure is "trivial").

"""
    escape_value(value::AbstractString)::String

Given some raw `value` (name of an axis, axis entry or property, or a parameter value), which may contain special
characters, return an escaped version to be used as a single value [`Token`](@ref).

We need to consider the following kinds of characters:

  - **Safe** ([`is_value_char`](@ref)) characters include `a` - `z`, `A` - `Z`, `0` - `9`, `_`, `+`, `-`, and `.`, as
    well as any non-ASCII (that is, Unicode) characters. Any sequence of these characters will be considered a single
    value [`Token`](@ref). These cover all the common cases (including signed integer and floating point values).

  - All other ASCII characters are (at least potentially) **special**, that is, may be used to describe an operation.
  - Prefixing **any** character with a `\\` allows using it inside a value [`Token`](@ref). This is useful if some name
    or value contains a special character. For example, if you have a cell whose name is `ACTG:Plate1`, and you want to
    access the name of the batch of this specific cell, you will have to write `/ cell = ACTG\\:Plate1 : batch`.

!!! note

    The `\\` character is also used by Julia inside `"..."` string literals, to escape writing non-printable characters.
    For example, `"\\n"` is a single-character string containing a line break, and therefore `"\\\\"` is used to write a
    single `\\`. Thus the above example would have to be written as `"cell = ACTG\\\\:Plate1 : batch"`. This isn't nice.

    Luckily, Julia also has `raw"..."` string literals that work similarly to Python's `r"..."` strings (in Julia,
    `r"..."` is a regular expression, not a string). Inside raw string literals, a `\\` is a `\\` (unless it precedes a
    `"`). Therefore the above example could also be written as `raw"/ cell = ACTG\\:Plate1 : batch`, which is more
    readable.

Back to `escape_value` - it will prefix any special character with a `\\`. It is useful if you want to programmatically
inject a value. Often this happens when using `\$(...)` to embed values into a query string, e.g., do not write a query
`/ \$(axis) @ \$(property)` as it is unsafe, as any of the embedded variables may contain unsafe characters. You should
instead write something like `/ \$(escape_value(axis)) @ \$(escape_value(property))`.

A parsed token of an expression.

We distinguish between "value" tokens and "operator" tokens using `is_operator`. A value token holds the name of an
axis, axis entry or property, or a parameter value, while an operator token is used to identify a query operation to
perform. In both cases, the `value` contains the token string. This goes through both [`decode_expression`](@ref) and
[`unescape_value`](@ref) so it can be directly used as-is for value tokens.

We also keep the location (`first_index` .. `last_index`) and the (encoded) expression string, to enable generating
friendly error messages. There are no line numbers in locations because in `Daf` we squash our queries to a single-line,
under the assumption they are "relatively simple". This allows us to simplify the code.

    tokenize(string::AbstractString, operators::Regex)::Vector{Token}

Given an expression string, convert it into a vector of [`Token`](@ref).

We first convert everything that matches the [`SPACE_REGEX`](@ref) into a single space. This squashed the expression
into a single line (discarding line breaks and comments), and the squashed expression is used for reporting errors. This
is reasonable for dealing with `Daf` queries which are expected to be "relatively simple".

When tokenizing, we discard the spaces. Anything that matches the [`VALUE_REGEX`](@ref) is considered to be a value
[`Token`](@ref). Anything that matches the `operators` is considered to be an operator [`Token`](@ref). As a special
case, `''` is converted to an empty string, which is otherwise impossible to represent (write `\\'\\'` to prevent this).
Anything else is reported as an invalid character.

!!! note

    The `operators` regex should only match the start of the string (that is, must start with `^`). Also, when using
    `|`, you need to list the longer operators first (e.g., `^(?:++|+)` as opposed to `^(?:+|++)`).

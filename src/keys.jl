Identify data inside a `Daf` data set using a key. These types are used in various high-level API parameters.

A separate key space is used for axes and data; thus, both axes and scalars use a simple string key.

"""
A key specifying some tensor in `Daf` by its axes and name. `Daf` is restricted to storing 0D, 1D and 2D data, for good
reasons; higher dimensional data raises sticky issues about layout and there is no support for any sparse representation
(which is even more important for this kind of data). However, sometimes it is necessary to store 3D data in `Daf`. In
this case, we pick the 1st axis as the main one, and store a series of `<main-axis-entry>_<property_name>` matrices
using the other two axes (whose order doesn't matter). Access is only to each specific matrix, not to the whole 3D
tensor. However, it is useful to be able to specify the whole set of matrices for copying, views, cobtracts, etc.

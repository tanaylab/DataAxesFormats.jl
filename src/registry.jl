Registering element-wise and reduction operations is required, to allow them to be used in a query.

!!! note

    We do not re-export everything from here to the main `Daf` namespace, as it is only of interest for implementers of
    new query operations. Most users of `Daf` just stick with the (fairly comprehensive) list of built-in query
    operations so there's no need to pollute their namespace with these detail.

"""
Abstract type for all element-wise operations.

In a string query, this is specified using the `%` operator (e.g., `% Abs`, `% Log base 2`):

`EltwiseOperation` := `%` operation ( parameter value )*

Since each `EltwiseOperation` isa [`QueryOperation`](@ref), you can directly apply it to a query (e.g.,
`Axis("cell") |> Lookup("age") |> Abs()`). For this there should be other constructor(s) tailored for this usage.

An element-wise operation may be applied to scalar, vector ot matrix data. It will preserve the shape of the data, but
changes the value(s), and possibly the data type of the elements. For example, `Abs` will compute the absolute value of
each value.

To implement a new such operation, the type is expected to be of the form:

    struct MyOperation <: EltwiseOperation
        ... optional parameters ...
    end
    @query_operation MyOperation

    MyOperation(operation_name::Token, parameter_values::Dict{String, Token})::MyOperation

The constructor should use `parse_parameter` for each of the parameters (for example, using `parse_number_assignment`).
In addition you will need to invoke [`@query_operation`](@ref) to register the operation so it can be used in a query,
and implement the functions listed below. See the query operations module for details and examples.

"""
Abstract type for all reduction operations.

In a string query, this is specified using the `%>` operator (e.g., `%> Sum`, `%> Quantile fraction 0.05`):

`ReductionOperation` := `%>` operation ( parameter value )*

Since each `ReductionOperation` isa [`QueryOperation`](@ref), you can directly apply it to a query (e.g.,
`Axis("cell") |> Axis("gene") |> Lookup("UMIs") |> Quantile(0.05)`). For this there should be other constructor(s)
tailored for this usage.

A reduction operation may be applied to matrix or vector data. It will reduce (eliminate) one dimension of the data, and
possibly the result will have a different data type than the input. When applied to a vector, the operation will return
a scalar. When applied to a matrix, it assumes the matrix is in column-major layout, and will return a vector with one
entry per column, containing the result of reducing the column to a scalar.

To implement a new such operation, the type is expected to be of the form:

    struct MyOperation <: ReductionOperation
        ... optional parameters ...
    end

    MyOperation(operation_name::Token, parameter_values::Dict{String, Token})::MyOperation

The constructor should use `parse_parameter` for each of the parameters (for example, using typically
`parse_number_assignment`). In addition you will need to invoke [`@query_operation`](@ref) to register the operation so
it can be used in a query, and implement the functions listed below. See the query operations module for details and
examples.

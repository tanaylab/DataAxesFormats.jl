"""
Only a restricted set of scalar, matrix and vector types is stored by `Daf`.

The set of scalar types is restricted because we need to be able to store them in disk files. This rules out compound
types such as `Dict`. This isn't an issue for vector and matrix elements but is sometimes bothersome for "scalar" data
(not associated with any axis). If you find yourself needed to store such data, you'll have to serialize it to a string.
By convention, we use `JSON` blobs for such data to maximize portability between different systems.

Julia supports a potentially infinite variety of ways to represent matrices and vectors. `Daf` is intentionally
restricted to specific representations. This has several advantages:

  - `Daf` storage formats need only implement storing these restricted representations, which lend themselves to simple
    storage in consecutive bytes (in memory and/or on disk). These representations also allow for memory-mapping the
    data from disk files, which allows `Daf` to deal with data sets larger than the available memory.

  - Client code need only worry about dealing with these restricted representations, which limits the amount of code
    paths required for efficient algorithm implementations. However, you (mostly) need not worry about this when
    invoking library functions, which have code paths covering all common matrix types. You **do** need to consider the
    layout of the data, though (see below).

This has the downside that `Daf` doesn't support efficient storage of specialized matrices (to pick a random example,
upper triangular matrices). This isn't a great loss, since `Daf` targets storing arbitrary scientific data (especially
biological data), which in general is not of any such special shape. The upside is that all matrices stored and returned
by `Daf` have a clear layout (regardless of whether they are dense or sparse). This allows user code to ensure it is
working "with the grain" of the data, which is **much** more efficient.

!!! note

    Currently all boolean vectors are matrices are stored internally using one byte per entry (that is, as
    `Vector{Bool}` and `Matrix{Bool}` rather than `BitVector` and `BitMatrix`. This is somewhat less efficient, but is
    simpler and Boolean data is rarely a significant part of either storage or processing.

This is restricted to [`StorageReal`](@ref) (including Booleans) and strings. It is arguably too restrictive, as in
principle we could support any arbitrary `isbitstype`. However, in practice this would cause much trouble when accessing
the data from other systems (specifically Python and R). Since `Daf` targets storing scientific data (especially
biological data), as opposed to "anything at all", this restriction seems reasonable.
